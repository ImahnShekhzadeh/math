- write down definition of (probability) simplex; LLM: 
> A "simplex" in mathematics refers to a generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions. Specifically, an $n$-simplex is the simplest possible polytope in an $n$-dimensional space. For example, a $0$-simplex is a point, a $1$-simplex is a line segment, a $2$-simplex is a triangle, a $3$-simplex is a tetrahedron, and so on.

> A "probability simplex" is a specific kind of simplex used in the context of probability theory and statistics. It is the space of all possible probability distributions over a finite set of events. For a set of $n + 1$ events, the probability simplex is an $n$-simplex. Each vertex of the simplex represents a distribution where one event has a probability of $1$ and the rest have a probability of $0$. Any point inside the simplex represents a probability distribution where at least two events have a nonzero probability, and the sum of the probabilities for all events equals $1$. This constraint is because the total probability for all possible outcomes must equal $1$ in a probability distribution. The coordinates of any point in this simplex correspond to the probabilities of each event. 
- also write down the definition of a tetrahedron: 
> A tetrahedron is a three-dimensional geometric figure, also known as a triangular pyramid, consisting of four triangular faces, six straight edges, and four vertex corners. Each of the faces is a triangle, and they come together to form a single solid shape. In a regular tetrahedron, all four faces are equilateral triangles, and the shape is one of the five Platonic solids, which are convex polyhedra with faces composed of congruent, regular polygons and the same number of faces meeting at each vertex. 

- Wikipedia: The tetrahedron is an example of a convex polyhedra. To see why it is indeed only $6$ edges, take a look at [this figure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron#/media/File:Symmetries_of_the_tetrahedron.svg). 

- write down what a uniform categorical distribution is. LLM: 
> A uniform categorical distribution is discrete and deals with a finite set of distinct categories where each outcome has an equal chance of occurring. For example, if you have a six-sided die, each side (each category) has an equal probability of 1/6 when rolled.
>                                                                                   
> A standard uniform distribution, often just called a uniform distribution, typically refers to a continuous distribution. The continuous uniform distribution is defined over an interval, say [a, b], and any point within this interval is equally likely to be drawn. If you're referring to "uniform distribution ten" as a uniform distribution between 0 and 10, any number between 0 and 10 is equally likely to be chosen, and the probability density function is constant over this interval.
